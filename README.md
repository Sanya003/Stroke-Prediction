# Stroke-Prediction
This project focuses on developing a predictive model for stroke detection using machine learning techniques. The model aims to assist in identifying individuals at a high risk of stroke based on various health and demographic factors.

## Overview
Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and long-term disability worldwide. Early prediction of stroke can significantly improve outcomes by enabling timely medical interventions. This project explores the use of machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of a stroke occurring in a patient, leveraging data from medical histories, lifestyle choices, and physiological measurements.

## Key Features -
- **Data Preprocessing** : Handling missing values, outlier detection, and normalization of data.
- **Feature Selection** : Identifying the most critical features that contribute to stroke prediction.
- **Model Building** : Implementing and comparing various machine learning models - Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
- **Model Evaluation** : Utilizing metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC to evaluate model performance.
- **Interpretability** : Provide insights into feature importance and model decision-making.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of anonymized health records, which include information on age, hypertension, heart disease, average glucose level, BMI, and smoking status, among others.

## Goal
The primary objective is to build a robust and accurate model that can predict stroke events with high precision, ultimately aiding healthcare providers in early diagnosis and preventive care.
